										<p>We are Games For Ed.<br>

										A team of educators and creators who believe classrooms should spark curiosity, not routine. We design learning experiences that feel like stories you can step into — playful, surprising, and deeply human.
Our roots stretch from Asia School of Business and MIT Sloan to TRIO World School to the Harvard Graduate School of Education, but what truly binds us is a love for play and discovery. We do this because we’ve seen that learning works best when it excites the imagination, builds teamwork, and leaves students with ideas they’ll carry far beyond the classroom.</p>
										
										<p>At Games For Ed, every experience is crafted to surprise, delight, and stay with you — because great learning feels a lot like great storytelling.</p>
