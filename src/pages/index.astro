                            <p>Our roots stretch from the Harvard Graduate School of Education to Asia School of Business, MIT Sloan, and TRIO World School, but what truly binds us is a love for play and discovery.</p>
                            
                            <p>We’ve seen, again and again, that learning works best when it is active and engaging. When it excites the imagination, builds teamwork, and leaves students with ideas they carry far beyond the classroom.</p>
                            
                            <p>At Games For Ed, every experience is thoughtfully designed around play, with stories and challenges that bring learning to life and stay with students long after class ends.</p>
