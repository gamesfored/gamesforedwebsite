Homepage,The box where the picture of the three of us is there,text change in the paragraph. ,"We are Games For Ed.
We are a team of educators and creators designing playful, experience-based learning for classrooms.

Our roots stretch from the Harvard Graduate School of Education to Asia School of Business, MIT Sloan, and TRIO World School, but what truly binds us is a love for play and discovery.

We’ve seen, again and again, that learning works best when it is active and engaging. When it excites the imagination, builds teamwork, and leaves students with ideas they carry far beyond the classroom.

At Games For Ed, every experience is thoughtfully designed around play, with stories and challenges that bring learning to life and stay with students long after class ends."

Our story,What makes Games for Ed different ,The aligning of our games and we design experiences is very off. Because of the extra Where ,
Our story,Where we're headed,,"We are building a library of game-based learning experiences designed for real classrooms and real learners.

Our long-term vision is to help schools move beyond content delivery toward experience-driven learning, where play, choice, and reflection shape understanding.

We want students to leave classrooms not just knowing facts, but understanding ideas — making connections, asking thoughtful questions, and carrying curiosity with them."
Our story,Who we are,text,"Each of us comes from a slightly different background, but we share a common instinct: boredom is rarely the student’s fault, its a signal to rethink how learning is designed."
Our Story,How games for Ed came to be,text,"Games For Ed did not start with a business plan or a product roadmap. It started with a classroom moment most educators recognize.

Bright students. Capable teachers. And yet, learning felt heavy.

We kept seeing the same pattern across schools. Students could repeat answers, but struggled to explain ideas. They memorized, but forgot. Curiosity slowly faded, even in spaces meant to nurture it.

But when students played games, something changed. They discussed and debated. They negotiated. They tried again after failing. They remembered concepts weeks later. They took ownership of their learning."

and then include two school leader comments too. 

It'll also make it 9!! SO there's no blank space. ","- School Leader 1 
What stood out was how clearly students could talk about their decisions and learning, even after the game was over.
- School Leader 2 
What I noticed was students taking ownership of their learning. They spoke with confidence about their choices, without looking for approval or the “right” answer."
