## **Impact & Voices from the Classroom**

### **How We Think About Impact**

At Games For Ed, we’re cautious about how we talk about impact.

We don’t look for loud transformations or instant results. We pay attention to smaller signals that tell us whether learning is landing.

Sometimes those signals show up in the classroom.\
Sometimes they show up later, at home, during dinner table conversations.

Both matter.

### **What We’re Seeing So Far**

Across our sessions and early pilots, a few patterns keep repeating.

Students tend to:

- stay engaged for longer than expected

- explain their thinking more clearly during play

- reference earlier choices during reflection

- remember details days after the session

Teachers often notice that:

- quieter students participate more actively

- collaboration feels more balanced

- assessment becomes more visible through discussion

- conversations continue beyond the session

Occasionally, teachers also share that parents mention dinner table conversations where students explain the game, defend their decisions, or retell the experience at home.

We treat these moments as signals, not conclusions.

***


### **Why These Signals Matter to Us**

Learning doesn’t always announce itself.

It shows up when students:

- can retell an experience in their own words

- connect ideas across contexts

- revisit decisions after time has passed

- feel confident enough to explain, not just answer

Dinner table conversations are one of many places where this becomes visible. Not because they are planned, but because they are unprompted.

For us, that matters.

### **What Students Say**

“I liked that we had to decide together. I told my parents what our group argued about.”

“At first it was confusing, but later it made sense when I explained it at home.”

“I remembered the rules even after a few days.”

“I don’t usually talk in class, but in the game I had to.”

***


### **What Teachers Say**

“Students who don’t usually speak were much more involved.”

“I could see their thinking clearly while they were playing.”

“Some parents mentioned their children talking about the activity at home.”

“The reflection felt more thoughtful than usual.”

### **What This Means for Schools**

We’re still building and learning, and we’re transparent about that.

But these patterns give us confidence that our approach supports:

- deeper engagement

- clearer thinking

- stronger student voice

- learning that doesn’t end when the class does
