**Our Story**


### **How Games For Ed Came to Be**

Games For Ed did not start with a business plan or a product roadmap.\
It started with a classroom moment most educators recognize.

Bright students. Capable teachers.\
And yet, learning felt heavy.

We kept seeing the same pattern across schools. Students could repeat answers, but struggled to explain ideas. They memorized, but forgot. They completed worksheets, but switched off emotionally. Curiosity slowly faded, even in spaces meant to nurture it.

At the same time, we noticed something else.

When students played games, something changed.\
They argued. They negotiated. They tried again after failing. They remembered details weeks later. They cared.

That contrast stayed with us.

Games For Ed was born from the belief that **play is not the opposite of learning. Play is how learning becomes real.**

### **What We Believe About Learning**

We believe learning works best when students are active participants, not quiet receivers.

When students:

- make choices

- face consequences

- collaborate and compete

- tell stories

- fail safely and try again

learning stops being abstract. It becomes lived experience.

Games do something powerful. They create systems. And in systems, patterns matter more than individuals. There is no single hero. There is no perfect ending. Meaning emerges slowly, often only when the game ends.

That idea shapes everything we design.

### **Why Games, Not Just Activities**

We don’t use games as a reward or a break.\
We use them as the **core learning structure**.

A well-designed game:

- has clear rules

- creates tension

- forces trade-offs

- mirrors real-world complexity

- makes thinking visible

Whether it’s financial literacy, climate action, entrepreneurship, or social-emotional learning, our games are built so students learn _by doing_, not by being told.

We design for classrooms as they are, not as ideal versions we wish existed. Limited time. Mixed abilities. Real constraints.

### **Our Roots**

Our work is shaped by experiences and research from spaces like:

- Asia School of Business

- MIT Sloan

- Harvard Graduate School of Education

- TRIO World School

But more importantly, it’s shaped by sitting on classroom floors, running pilots that break, watching students misunderstand rules, and redesigning again.

We learn by building, testing, failing, and refining. Just like our games.

### **Who We Are**

We are educators, designers, facilitators, and curious humans who believe learning should feel alive.

Each of us comes from a slightly different background, but we share a common instinct:\
If students are bored, it’s not their fault. It’s a design problem.

This page will show our illustrated versions, but behind the drawings are people who:

- care deeply about schools

- respect teachers’ realities

- obsess over clarity and flow

- believe joy and rigour can coexist

You’ll find our LinkedIn profiles here because we value transparency. We want schools to know who they are working with.

### **What Makes Games For Ed Different**

We don’t design games that sit on shelves.

Our games are:

- built for real classrooms

- easy for teachers to facilitate

- grounded in learning goals

- flexible across ages and contexts

We design experiences where:

- no one “wins” alone

- collaboration matters

- systems reveal themselves over time

- reflection is as important as action

Learning does not end with a surprise twist. It ends with recognition.

### **Where We’re Headed**

We’re building a growing library of game-based learning experiences that schools can trust.

Our long-term goal is simple:\
To help schools move from content delivery to experience design.

We want students to leave classrooms not just knowing more, but understanding better. To see patterns. To ask better questions. To stay curious.

If that sounds like the kind of learning environment you care about, we’d love to talk.
